This is a mobile-responsive Snake & Ladder game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a two-player turn-based game where players roll a dice to move their tokens from 1 to 100 on a colorful 10×10 board. The game includes random snakes and ladders for every new game, making it fun and unpredictable.

🔹 Features

✅ Two Players – Player 1 (🔵) and Player 2 (🔴).
✅ Dice Rolling System – Random values (1–6).
✅ Random Snakes & Ladders – Each new game generates different snake heads/tails and ladder positions.
✅ Snake Bite Effect – If a player lands on a snake head, they go back to the tail.
✅ Ladder Climb Effect – If a player lands on a ladder bottom, they move up to the top.
✅ Winner Announcement – The first player to reach 100 is declared the winner.
✅ Restart Button – Restart the game anytime with new snake and ladder positions.
✅ Responsive Design – Works on both desktop and mobile screens.
✅ Colorful UI – Alternate cell colors, snake 🐍 markers in green, and ladder 🪜 markers in brown.

🔹 Game Flow

Both players start at cell 1.

Players take turns rolling the dice.

Based on the dice number, the token moves forward.

If the player lands on:

Snake Head → Player slides down to the tail.

Ladder Bottom → Player climbs up to the top.

The game continues until one player reaches cell 100.

The winner is displayed on screen 🎉.

🔹 Tech Stack

HTML → Structure of the board and controls.

CSS → Styling, responsive layout, and colorful cells.

JavaScript → Game logic (dice rolling, turn switching, snakes & ladders, winner check, restart).

🔹 Future Enhancements (Optional)

Add step-by-step movement animation instead of instant jumps.

Show a dice image instead of just a number.

Keep a scoreboard of wins for Player 1 and Player 2.

Add sound effects when dice rolls, snake bites, or ladder climbs.

⚡ This project is simple yet engaging and is a great example of applying JavaScript game logic with DOM manipulation.
